<title>Requirements</title>

<p>
<app>MATE Eiciel</app> is an application for the <app>GNOME</app> environment. 
To be useful <app>MATE Eiciel</app> needs an ACL-enabled system.
</p>

<note style="advanced">
<p>
ACL support is given by the operating system. Nowadays only Linux 2.6 (or 2.4
with the proper patch) and FreeBSD 5 support ACL. However not all the filesystems
that can be used on those systems have support for ACL.
</p>
<p>
In Linux 2.6, when writing this documentation, the following filesystems where
ACL-capable: Ext2/Ext3, XFS, JFS and ReiserFS. ACL must be enabled in the 
<sys>kernel</sys>. It is also possible that NFS and CIFS filesystems 
become ACL-capable in the future.
</p>
<p>
Note also that ACL must be <em>turned on</em>. In Linux 2.6/2.4 you can do 
it setting the <sys>acl</sys> option in <file>/etc/fstab</file>.
Consult your distribution documentation
